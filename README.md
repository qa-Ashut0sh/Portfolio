## About me
I am a QA Engineer with 4 years of experience in functional and non-functional testing across domains like shipping, healthcare, appointment scheduling, and EdTech. Through hard work and continuous learning, I‚Äôve grown from a beginner to a skilled tester. I‚Äôve handled large projects independently and also worked effectively as part of a team. My expertise is also showcased in over 100 published tech articles. I bring the versatility of a pro all-rounder‚Äîlike Hardik Pandya‚Äîwho can bowl critical bugs toward developers and bat to defend applications, to ensure they remain bug-free.
